### Project Instructions for Collaborative ggplot Graph Creation Using GitHub

1. **Repository Setup:**  
   One team member should start by creating a new GitHub repository. They need to manage access by giving write permissions to the other team members by adding them as contributors.

2. **Task Division:**  
   Split the graph creation process into three phases:
   1. Loading the data.
   2. Setting up the aesthetic mappings and adding labels.
   3. Finalizing the details.
   Assign each phase to a different team member. If you have four team members, split the final phase into two separate tasks to produce four distinct graphs.

3. **Collaborative Workflow:**  
   Each team member should take their turn contributing to the script in their assigned phase. Work sequentially:
   - Fork the repository.
   - Clone it to your local machine.
   - Develop your assigned code.
   - Push the changes back to your fork.
   - Open a pull request to merge the changes.

   **Important Tip:** Ensure that each member forks the repository only after the previous memberâ€™s pull request has been merged, so that everyone works on the latest version of the code.

4. **Pull Request Management:**  
   Whoever is responsible for the first phase (loading the data) will also be in charge of merging all the pull requests into the main branch.

5. **Graph Variety:**  
   Use different datasets to create distinct types of visualizations. Avoid repeating the same type of graph (e.g., no three scatter plots).

6. **Separate Files:**  
   Create separate R scripts or RMarkdown files for each visualization.

7. **Submission:**  
   Provide the link to the GitHub repository where the pull requests were reviewed and approved.
